## Introduction
The **FundRaising Smart Contract Suite** aims to simplify the creation of blockchain-based fundraising projects. With dual-currency support, contributors can fund projects using ETH or equivalent USD, calculated using real-time price feeds. Additionally, the contract includes safeguards like minimum/maximum contribution limits, funding caps, and contributor tracking to ensure transparency and reliability.

This repository is powered by **Foundry**, a powerful Ethereum development framework, offering tools for contract testing, deployment, and scripting.

## Key Features
- Dual Currency Support: Accepts contributions in ETH and USD, ensuring flexibility for users.
- Custom Funding Goals: Define funding goals in ETH and USD, with automatic tracking of progress.
- Contributor Safeguards:
    - Enforces minimum and maximum contribution limits.
    - Stops contributions once the funding goal is met.
    - Restricts the maximum number of contributors.
- Secure Withdrawals: Allows only the contract owner to withdraw funds once goals are achieved.
- Comprehensive Testing: Includes edge cases and failure scenarios for maximum reliability.
- Dynamic Configuration: Adapts seamlessly to different chains like Mainnet, Sepolia, and local networks.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**:

    - Install Foundry.
    - Ensure you have a compatible Ethereum wallet and a funded test account.
2. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```
3. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
forge install
```
4. **Run Tests**: Verify the implementation using Foundryâ€™s testing framework:

```bash

## Contract Overview
### FundRaising Contract
The `FundRaising` contract is the core component of this suite. It handles contributions, tracks funding progress, and manages withdrawals.

### Key Methods:
1. **Funding in ETH**:

```solidity
function fundWithEth() public payable;
```

Accepts ETH contributions, enforcing minimum and maximum limits.

2. **Funding in USD**:

```solidity
function fundWithUsd() public payable;
```
Accepts USD contributions, converted using the chain's price feed.

3. **Withdrawals**:

```solidity
function withdraw() external;
```
Allows only the owner to withdraw funds once the goal is reached.

4. **Funding Limits**:

    + `getMinEthAmount()`: Returns the minimum ETH contribution.
    + `getMinUsdAmount()`: Returns the minimum USD contribution.
    + `getMaxAmountInEth()`: Returns the maximum ETH contribution.
    + `getMaxAmountInUsd()`: Returns the maximum USD contribution.

---
## HelperConfig
The `HelperConfig` contract centralizes network configuration, adapting the deployment to Mainnet, Sepolia, or a local environment.

**Core Methods**:

  + `getConfigByChainId(uint256 chainId)`: Returns configuration details (e.g., price feed) for the specified chain.
  
+ **Mock Price Feed**:

  + Simulates USD price feeds in local development environments.

## Interaction Scripts

The interaction scripts simplify interaction with the `FundRaising` contract for funding and withdrawal operations.

### Funding (ETH/USD)

#### ETH Funding:

Script: `FundFundRaisingInEth`

```solidity
function fundFundRaisingInEth(address mostRecentlyDeployed) public {
    FundRaising(payable(mostRecentlyDeployed)).fundWithEth{value: SEND_VALUE}();
}
```

- Sends ETH to the contract, ensuring contribution limits are met.

#### USD Funding:
Script: `FundFundRaisingInUsd`

```solidity
function fundFundRaisingInUsd(address mostRecentlyDeployed) public {
    FundRaising(payable(mostRecentlyDeployed)).fundWithUsd{value: SEND_VALUE}();
}
```

- Sends USD-equivalent funds to the contract.


### Withdrawals

#### Withdraw Script:

Script: `WithdrawFundRaising`

```solidity
function withdrawFundRaising(address mostRecentlyDeployed) public {
    FundRaising(payable(mostRecentlyDeployed)).withdraw();
}
```

- Allows the owner to withdraw funds once the goal is achieved.
---

## Testing Suite

The project includes an extensive suite of tests to ensure reliability under various conditions. All tests are implemented using Foundryâ€™s `Test` module.

### Key Test Cases

#### Basic Validations

 + **Minimum/Maximum Contributions**:
    + `testFundWithEthFailsIfMinEthIsNotMet`
    + `testFundWithUsdFailsIfMinUsdIsNotMet`
  
 + **Goal Validation**:
    + `testFundWithEthFailsIfGoalHasBeenReached`
    + `testFundWithUsdFailsIfGoalHasBeenReached`

 #### Edge Cases

 + **Maximum Contributors**:
    + `testFundFailsWhenFundingIsFull``
 + **Invalid Configurations**:
    + testGetConfigByInvalidChainId

#### Withdrawal Logic

+ Validates correct behavior when funds are withdrawn by the owner.
+ Ensures balances update accurately after withdrawal.

### Mock Price Feed

Tests the integration of the mock price feed for local environments.

### Run Tests:

```bash
forge test
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Payment Options**:

    - Integrate other stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC) for funding.

2. **Advanced Withdrawal Logic**:

    - Add support for milestone-based withdrawals.

3. **Dynamic Goal Adjustments**:

    - Enable the owner to update funding goals mid-campaign.

4. **Cross-Chain Support**:

    - Expand functionality to handle contributions across multiple chains.

5. **UI Integration**:

    - Develop a front-end interface for easier interaction.

## Conclusion

The **FundRaising Smart Contract Suite** provides a robust framework for decentralized crowdfunding. With dual-currency support, flexible funding goals, and secure withdrawals, it is well-suited for a variety of blockchain-based fundraising applications. Designed with Foundry, the suite ensures reliability and scalability, empowering developers to create impactful projects in the Web3 ecosystem.
